Flickr-Zoom
===========

It helps you to focus, just hold down the ALT and click on an image.

and this is where things get interesting, the browser will zoom directly to this image and replaces it with its high resolution version (if it's available).

You can check the [following video of Flickr-Zoom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSBF2OwHg0) on Youtube.

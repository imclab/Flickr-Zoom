Flickr-Zoom
===========

After installing the extension, go to Flickr, hold down the ALT key and click on an image.

and this is where things get interesting, the browser will zoom directly to this image and replaces it with its high resolution version (if it's available).

You can check the [following video of Flickr-Zoom](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSBF2OwHg0) on Youtube.

You can install [the extension from the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bdhndpjaddhjhafbbpplnhjpgcfbdkbk)
